                    The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global information space comprising linked documents. 
                    Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space based on open standards.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing of Semantic data Web and Linked Data technologies additional to development data mining methods in data sciences field, contribute in growing the role semantic data web in developing enterprise systems for many goals. 
                    The idea is to use the Linked Open Data Cloud for retrieving additional information on e.g. demographics or economics to enrich the data sets at hand before analyzing them. 
                    <br><br>
                    The project concentrates on financial data and detects outlier then compares the results. 
                    Certain data mining methods can be applied to these separate datasets (Financial data) to efficiently detect anomalies/outliers, and by the use of Semantic Web concepts, we can have even more accurate findings.
