Made by Alina Arunova, Maxim Maltsev, Philipp Matyash, Sattar Rahimbeyli.
Mentor: Irl√°n Grangel.

## Motivation
The goal of Industry 4.0 is to consolidate the standards. The importance of the project is resulted from the fact that globalization forces large companies to go international, and followed by the ability to handle with different industrial standards. In order to avoid wasting time onto manual object notation transcription, Industrial 4.0 tool was made up.	
The aim of the research group is to create a web-based tool that uses RDF(S) vocabularies for integrating instances of such standards as AutomationML and OPCUA into one piece.

## Dependencies
This tool depends on the following software

* Ubuntu
* Virtuoso
* Tomcat
