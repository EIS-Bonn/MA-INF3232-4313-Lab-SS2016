PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE OR USING THE PRODUCT(S) OR SKYPE WEBSITES

Key Points
It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:

NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype’s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.

CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE: In some regions there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located.

NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS: If Skype allocates to you a Skype Number or Skype To Go Number, you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Skype Number or Skype To Go Number to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing a Skype Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 19.1.

SKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS: If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. Please see also paragraph 9.2.

2.3 In some countries the Products may be provided to you by Skype’s local partner. If so, that local partner may ask you to accept its own terms of service (“local terms”).

5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only)
5.6.1 In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect. See the full list of countries (“Enabled Countries”) and software versions and other platforms (“Enabled Versions”) that enable limited Skype emergency calling. Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms. You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype’s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort. In particular, please also note that:
(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services. Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection.
(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.
(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you. If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software. Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.
(iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using Skype’s APIs, any of Skype’s software development kits or otherwise).
5.6.2 In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)). It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world. Where limited emergency calling is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance. If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software. If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.

Additionally, Skype may remove your content without asking you if we determine it is in violation these Terms or the law or if we receive a notice of intellectual property infringement from a third party.
5.8 Notice and Take-Down: If Skype receives any notification that any material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the Skype Website or through the Software (excluding your private communications) (“User Submission”) is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third party, or if Skype wishes to remove your User Submission for any reason whatsoever, Skype reserves the right to automatically remove such User Submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may be decided from time to time by Skype in its sole discretion.

Any false, misleading or inaccurate information provided by you may result in civil and criminal liability.
5.9 Quality: Skype cannot guarantee that the Software, Products or Skype Websites will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. A number of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the Software, Products (depending on the Products used) or Skype Websites, and may result in the failure of your communications including but not limited to: your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public internet, the public switched telephone network and your power supply. Skype takes no responsibility for any disruption, interruption or delay caused by any failure of or inadequacy in any of these items or any other items over which we have no control.
5.10 Changes to Products: Skype is constantly improving the Software and Products and may change them at any time. Additionally, there are reasons why Skype may stop providing the Software and Products (or portions thereof) including (without limitation) that it is no longer feasible for us to provide it, the technology advances, customer feedback indicates a change is needed, external issues arise that make it imprudent or impractical to continue, or any reason set out in paragraph 11.2. As a result of such changes, you may need to use an upgraded version of the Software. Technical requirements for use of Products and Software and feature descriptions are available on the Skype Website. If you do not agree with any changes to Software and Products you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11. You may need to upgrade to a new version in order to enjoy the benefit of certain Products. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that certain Products may be subject to usage limits or geographical restrictions, which may vary from time to time. Please check the Skype Website for details of the most up-to-date usage restrictions that apply to the Products that you are using.
5.11 Unsolicited Ideas Skype does not consider or accept unsolicited proposals or ideas, including without limitation ideas for new products, technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product improvements (“Unsolicited Feedback”). If you send any Unsolicited Feedback to Skype through the Skype Website or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that Skype shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Unsolicited Feedback.
5.12 Reports Certain parts of the Skype Websites or the Software may ask for written suggestions or problem reports such as using our contact form or problem report form (“Reports”). Please read carefully any specific terms, which govern those Reports. The Reports shall be deemed the property of Skype. Skype shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Reports throughout the universe in perpetuity and shall be entitled to use the Reports for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Reports.

(iii) Skype may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers at any time without notice to you by posting such change at www.skype.com/go/allrates.

(iv) The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. The connection fee, where applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call. Any fractional currency unit charges will be rounded up to the nearest whole minimum currency unit, for example a total call price of €0.034 will be rounded up to €0.04. Charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Skype Credit balance in your User Account.
8.2 Charges for other Paid For Products: The charges for other Paid For Products will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from Skype. Skype may change the charges payable for the purchase of such Products at any time without any notice to you.

The new charges will apply to your next purchase after the new charges have been published. Fractional currency unit charges for SMS and Skype WiFi usage will be rounded up to the nearest whole minimum currency unit.

8.3 Promotional Offers: From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period.

8.4 Tax: All prices for Paid For Products are inclusive of applicable taxes, including VAT, unless otherwise stated. You explicitly waive any right to VAT reimbursement from Skype if the amount of VAT ultimately payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower than the amount of VAT collected from you. The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended. The Skype Website does not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this VAT exemption and we therefore do not provide the Products in such territories: Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Büsingen / Buesingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Livigno, Campione d'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano.
8.5 Third-Party Charges: Using the Software on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.

9.3 Other payment methods. Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you. Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.
9.4 Recurring Payments. Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.

(a) You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge.

In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time.
(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription.
